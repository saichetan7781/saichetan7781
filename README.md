I am a Machine Learning Engineer with over 3 years of experience building and deploying impactful AI/ML solutions. My expertise spans Generative AI, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and MLOps, with a strong foundation in AWS where I hold four certifications, enabling scalable cloud deployments.

Currently, I am a first-year Computer Science student at the University of Florida. Prior to UF, I earned my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Palakkad.

My passion lies at the intersection of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI (GenAI). I am committed to leveraging these technologies to solve real-world problems and empower data-driven business decisions.

At present, I work as a Research Assistant at UF, developing and training computational models to predict genetic variant pathogenicity, focusing specifically on gene-variant interactions and advancing precision genomics research.
